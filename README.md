# supervised-learning-project
This project explores and implements efficient supervised machine learning techniques for classification and regression. The project provides various supervised learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and suitable time series analysis algorithms.

The project leverages the California Housing Dataset, available as part of the sklearn datasets. This dataset is ideal for experimenting with various regression and classification algorithms, as it encompasses diverse features related to housing in California.
